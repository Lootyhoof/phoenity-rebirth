# Phoenity Rebirth
![Preview](https://i.imgur.com/HDSOOcx.png)

Firefox 3-alike (Vista/Win7 style) theme for Pale Moon using the [Phoenity Aura](https://github.com/cheeaun/phoenity-icons) icons. Based on [Aeromoon](https://github.com/Lootyhoof/aeromoon) with additions from [Qute Legacy](https://github.com/Lootyhoof/qutelegacy).

Use of the source code in this theme is as stated in LICENSE; use of the Phoenity Aura icons, however, is per the terms of the [CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).

## Building
Simply download the contents of the "src" folder  and pack the contents into a .zip file. Then, rename the file to .xpi and drag into the browser.

On Unix systems (or Windows 10, with [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)) you can optionally run `build.sh` instead. Running this as-is will produce a .xpi file ending in `-dev`, and if run from the command line and appending a number (e.g. `./build.sh 2`) will append that number to the filename instead.

## Download
You can grab the latest release either from the Releases section of this repository, or the [Pale Moon Add-Ons Site](https://addons.palemoon.org/addon/phoenity-rebirth/).
